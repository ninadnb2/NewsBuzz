# NewsBuzz

NewsBuzz is a new Android app that is developed using Kotlin. The project aimed to understand and implement the learnings of Android.

The working of the app is that app makes an API call to NewsApi using Retrofit to fetch live news. The fetched news is then displayed with the help of a recycler view. The user can tap on the news to read the whole news which is displayed in another activity. The app also has the functionality of CRUD operations which is performed using RoomDB. The user can save the news and read it according to their convenience. The news is saved in different activities which is displayed with help of a recycler view. Users can delete news from the same activity. 

Work manager is also used so that users can get notification of the news after an interval of 1hr. Custom Tab Intent is also applied so that news can be opened in Chrome within the app. The app also has the feature of sharing the news with other users.
